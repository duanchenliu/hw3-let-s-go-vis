            Hey there, do you want to learn about happiness?</div>
          <div class="card-body">
              <p>
              For this assignment, our group decided to explore The World Happiness Report, 
              which is a survey released by the United Nations on March 20th - official 
              “Day of Happiness”. The report ranks more than 150 countries by their happiness 
              level -  thus reviewing the current state of happiness in today’s society -  
              and it is a widespread data tool used to support policy-making decisions and 
              understand how well-being plays a role in nation progress. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The main happiness score was computed using the “Candrill Ladder of life” and 
              the data from the Gallup World Poll: a nationally representative sample of people 
              who were asked to rank their life from 0 (worst) to 10 (great) for the years 
              2013-2016 using Gallup weights. The data also contained extra six factors: economic 
              production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, 
              and generosity - which scores were based on how these factors contribute to making 
              life evaluations higher in each country compared to a hypothetical country with lowest 
              national averages for all factors (let’s call it Distopya). 
              </p>
              <img src="pic6.png" style="max-width:40%;">
              <p>
              Our team was curious to understand what drives happiness, and more specifically, 
              whether wealth in its most basic concept - money - is correlated with happiness. 
              Our main assumption is that higher-income results in higher well-being, which 
              consequently brings happiness. To evaluate this hypothesis, we merged to the 
              dataset GDP per capita - which should translate into an average income per 
              person given different countries. Although we understand and anticipate some 
              statistical issues - like GDP per capita does not consider income distribution/gap 
              - we believe it would be a great visualization exercise to understand the correlation, 
              code areas and plot different variables into a map. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Our initial idea was to build an interactive visualization composed of two main parts: 
              a map and a scatterplot. Both would connect by the key “country”. The map would encode 
              geographic location, population size (bubble size) and capital name; and the scatterplot 
              would display the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness score. In this way, 
              we could observe the correlation by analyzing trends in the scatterplot:
              </p>
              <img src="pic7.png" style="max-width:40%;">
              <p>
              The idea was, once the user clicks on a map capital, the correspondent country should be 
              highlighted on the scatterplot! Then, we added a couple of extra ideas: why not add in 
              extra information about each of the countries? To do so, we added Wikipedia page to our 
              dataset and every time a user clicked in a capital, it would not only highlight its respective 
              place in the scatterplot, but also a box would pop up with information about the country and 
              a direct link to its Wikipedia page. 
              </p>
              <img src="pic8.png" style="max-width:40%;">
              <p>
              Finally, we decided to add on the other available data to the scatterplot, thus creating 
              an interface where the user would be able to choose which axis would contain each possible 
              data - enabling people to explore all facets of the “The World Happiness Report”: happiness 
              rank, Family-friendly, freedom, and generosity. 
              </p>
